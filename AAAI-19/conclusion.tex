\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper we have proposed an extension of the DPP model that leverages
ideas from multi-class classification and tensor factorization.  While our model
can be applied to a number of machine learning problems, we focus on the problem
of basket completion.  We have shown through experiments on several datasets
that our model provides significant improvements in predictive quality compared
to a number of competing state-of-the-art approaches. In future work we plan to
investigate other applications of our model, such as user conversion prediction,
attribution, and adversarial settings in games.  We also plan to investigate
better negative sampling methods for positive-only and unlabelled data. Finally,
we also plan to investigate other types of loss functions, such as hinge loss,
and other types of link functions for DPPs, such as the Poisson function, to
tailor DPPs for regression problems. We believe that this work will allow 
us to customize DPPs so that they are suitable for many additional applications.
